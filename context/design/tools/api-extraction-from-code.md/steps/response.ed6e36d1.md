# response:

I am inferring the concept specifications for `ApplicationAssignments`, `ApplicationStorage`, `AuthAccounts`, `EventDirectory`, and `ReviewRecords` as if their full specification was available, based on the provided `Labeling` example and common understanding of these concept names.

For each concept, I will:

1. State the **Concept Name** and **Type Parameters** (inferred).
2. Provide an **inferred Purpose**.
3. Provide an **inferred Principle**.
4. Generate API documentation for a set of **inferred Actions** and **inferred Queries**, including descriptions, requirements, effects, and example JSON request/response bodies.
5. Use `ID` or `string` for generic types in JSON examples, as `ID` is a branded string.
6. Explicitly mention that these actions/queries are inferred due to the absence of direct specifications for these concepts in the prompt.

***
