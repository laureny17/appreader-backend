# AppReader Backend

[AppReader](http://appreader-2aji.onrender.com) is a full-stack admissions-management tool that supports both event administrators and volunteer readers. Admins can configure events, manage reader permissions, and review or resolve flagged applications from a central dashboard. Readers get a clean workflow for scoring applications with rubric-based criteria, tracking their progress, and viewing collaborative context like anonymized comments or leaderboard activity. Together, these features make large-scale application review more organized, transparent, and fair.
